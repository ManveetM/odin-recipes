        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
            <strong>Guacamole</strong> is an avocado-based dip or spread that 
            originated in Mexico. It's typically made with 
            mashed avocado and lime juice, then seasoned with 
            salt and cilantro. Guacamole often contains tomatoes 
            and onions.
